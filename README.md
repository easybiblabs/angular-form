# Angular-Form

A module to provide angular form validation using json validator with the help of angular-schema-form.
We have added some adjustments like

* invalidate any formfield beside json validation to be able to display backend errors.
* map doctrine backend validation to json schema validation ( enables to add constraints to entities in backend , and validate the form in javascript using the same constraints)
